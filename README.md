Starships is a simulation E-Commerce site that sells space ships.  We created our site using React and Redux with Semantic-UI for styling on the frontend.  We used NodeJS, Express and Postgres-Sequelize for the backend. On our site a visitor can browse Star Wars themed space ships to add to their cart. They can then proceed to the checkout page where they can securely checkout using Stripe.  We also implemented additional features such as a wish-list and the abilty to review products.
